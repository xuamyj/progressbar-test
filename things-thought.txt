- morning - some gather! afternoon! evening etc

- De notes that the event (screen 3) should train you further! not 5 stars 
- maybe if you do get "5 stars" you can get a free fish, om nom
- screen 2: later it should not be so thick (tall), more out of the way, have a little bouncy animation like the matcha cat animations

- screen 1: eventually inspect what skills people have, what supports people have
- screen 3: for the animation, do i want to keep track of scenes seen like in feh? 
- visually express that supports went up
